# Hello world!

I'm coding software for fun and for profit, always loving the impossible tasks.

Besides this GitHub profile, you can find other code by me on my
[personal Gitlab instance](https://praios.lf-net.org/littlefox), which I have since way
before GitHub got their own CI system.

You can also find me in other places of the interwebz, maybe take a look at my
[website/blog](https://lf-net.org)?

I use the same GitHub account for professional, paid work - you can expect that everything
I do outside that organization (linked as Company in GitHubs box for that) is my personal
opinion, not my employers.

Black lives matter, hire trans people or just randomly pay them, always help struggling
people when you can. Be excellent to each otter.
