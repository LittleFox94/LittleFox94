# Hello world!

I do computery things for fun (e.g. writing my own operating system, run overly complicated personal infrastructure, crashing servers) and for profit (not crashing servers, being technical lead for Kubernetes at @Anexia) and always love the "impossible" tasks.

Besides this GitHub profile, you can find other code by me on my [personal Gitlab instance](https://praios.lf-net.org/littlefox), which I have since way
before GitHub got their own CI system.

You can also find me in other places of the interwebz, maybe take a look at my [website/blog](https://lf-net.org)? There are some more links on that as well.

I use the same GitHub account for professional, paid work - generally, the things I write are my own opinion and not my employers and I will try to make it clear when it is actually my employers opinion.

Black lives matter, hire trans people or just randomly pay them, always help struggling people when you can. Be excellent to each otter.
